# Open Online Courses

### Purpose

In an attempt to self-learn computer science, embedded systems, web development, and other various topics, this is a list of online courses that I hope to accomplish over a long time. This repository holds solutions to online courses that I'm completing at the moment.

### Motivation

Being a part of Mechatronics Engineering, I contain a large knowledge gap in certain fields such as computer science fundametals, data structures & algorithms, and complex topics such as Embedded Systems, Web Dev, Operating Systems and even more. Mechatronics essentially provides an overview of topics and doesn't go in depth so I'm attempting to learn more concepts to expand my knowledge and fill in that gap.
